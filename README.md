# Simple NN

An extremely simple neural network written purely using Python and NumPy, and with detailed comments, docstring and type-hinting, made for educational purposes.

Some design choices were adapted from PyTorch, because in the end we would be using PyTorch, so understanding the implementation of it would be good.


## Execution

The following commands should be executed under `src` folder.

Generate data: `python gen_data.py`

Visualize data: `python visualize.py`

Train: `python train.py`


## Developer's Note

Currently, the network isn't good enough on XOR task. But the scale of the architecture should be enough to model XOR, I think it's just the hyperparameters that are not working.
